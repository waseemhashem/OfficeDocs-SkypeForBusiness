# Set up Phone System voicemail

This article is for the [Office 365 admin](https://support.office.com/article/da585eea-f576-4f55-a1e0-87090b6aaa9d) who wants to set up the Phone System voicemail feature for everyone in the business.

> [!NOTE]
> Phone System voicemail supports depositing voicemail messages only in an Exchange mailbox and doesn't support any third-party email systems. As a fallback mechanism, Phone System voicemail can resend messages using SMTP, which means users with a mailbox on a third-party email system will receive their voicemail messages with no guaranteed service uptime or other voicemail features, such as changing their greetings and other settings.

## Cloud-only environments: Set up Phone System voicemail

For Phone System and Calling Plans users, Cloud Voicemail is automatically set up and provisioned for users after you assign a **Phone System** license and a phone number to them.
  
1. If the Phone System feature isn't included in your plan, you may need to purchase **Phone System** add-on licenses. You may also need to purchase an Exchange Online license. See [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
    
2. [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc), the [Assign Microsoft Teams licenses](assign-teams-licenses.md), and the Exchange Online licenses to the people in your business. After you do that, they will be able to receive voicemail messages!
    
3. Voicemail transcription is enabled by default for all organizations and users. You can disable transcription for your organization using voicemail policy.

## Phone System with on-premises environments

The following information is about configuring Phone System voicemail to work with on-premises Calling Plan environments.
  
1. If the Phone System feature isn't included in your plan, you may need to purchase **Phone System** add-on licenses. You also need to purchase an Exchange Online license. See [Microsoft Teams add-on licensing](teams-add-on-licensing/microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing.md).
    
2. [Assign or remove licenses for Office 365 for business](http://support.office.com/article/997596b5-4173-4627-b915-36abac6786dc), the [Assign Microsoft Teams licenses](assign-teams-licenses.md), and the Exchange Online licenses to the people in your business.
    
3. Follow the instructions in the **Enable users for Phone System voice and voice mail services** section of the [Configure Skype for Business Cloud Connector Edition guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt605228.aspx).

4. Voicemail transcription is enabled by default for all organizations and users. You can disable transcription for your organization using voicemail policy.

## Setting voicemail policies in your organization

Voicemail transcription is enabled by default and transcription profanity masking is disabled by default for all organizations and users; however, you can control them by using the [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798310.aspx) and [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798311.aspx) cmdlets.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can't create a new policy instance for transcription and transcription profanity masking using the **New-CsOnlineVoiceMailPolicy** cmdlet, and you can't remove an existing policy instance using the **Remove-CsOnlineVoiceMailPolicy** cmdlet.

You can also manage the transcription settings for your users using voicemail policies. To see all available voicemail policy instances, you can use the [Get-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798311.aspx) cmdlet.

### Turning off transcription for your organization

Because the default setting for transcription is on for your organization, you may want to disable it by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798310.aspx). To do this, run:

```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscription $false
```

### Turning on transcription profanity masking for your organization

Transcription profanity masking is disabled by default for your organization. If there is a business requirement to enable it, you can enable transcription profanity masking by using [Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798310.aspx). To do this, run:

```
Set-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -EnableTranscriptionProfanityMasking $true
```

### Turning off transcription for a user

User policies are evaluated before the organizational default settings. For example, if voicemail transcription is enabled for all of your users, you can assign a policy to disable transcription for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798309.aspx) cmdlet.

To disable transcription for a single user, run:

```
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionDisabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

### Turning on transcription profanity masking for a user

To enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user, you can assign a policy to enable transcription profanity masking for a specific user by using the [Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt798309.aspx) cmdlet.

To enable transcription profanity masking for a single user, run:

```
Grant-CsOnlineVoicemailPolicy -PolicyName TranscriptionProfanityMaskingEnabled -Identity sip:amosmar@contoso.com
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The voicemail service in Office 365 caches voicemail policies and updates the cache every 4 hours. Policy changes may take up to 4 hours to be applied.
